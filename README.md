# The Vector Club Website
## Introduction:
Welcome to the Vector Club Website, the website to represent DPS International's very own mathematics club. It is a repository of resources, archives of past Vector Events and a log of all past members.
This was made in 2019 by Ashutosh Tripathi. It was managed in 2020-21 by the two webmasters - Chirag and Pranav.
There isn't much to say besides, to the next web master, remember the following things:
- **LOG THE WEBMASTERS IN THE TABLE BELOW**
- ~~**DO NOT REMOVE THE NAME OF THE CREATOR OF THE WEBSITE FROM THE FOOTER**~~ (Actually, nevermind, just have webmaster(s) in the footer from now)
- **REPLACE THE OLD WEBMASTERS FROM THE FOOTER WITH THE NEW ONE(s)**
- **MAKE SURE TO UPDATE THE MEMBERS PAGE, BY ADDING PREVIOUS MEMBERS AS ALUMNI**
- **DO NOT REMOVE ANY MEMBERS FROM THE ALUMNI PAGE. IF NEED BE, ADD ANOTHER PAGE FOR THE ALUMNI**
